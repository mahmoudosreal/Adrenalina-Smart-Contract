# Adrenalina Smart Contract

Adrenalina smart contract  
As a seasoned expert in the world of cryptocurrency trading, specifically on centralized platforms like Binance, I've noticed that many traders fall into the trap of risky trading. While it can lead to hefty profits, it can also result in losing all your capital. So, what's the culprit? Adrenaline. It's like trading with a blindfold on, controlled by the factors of greed and the desperate desire to make up for past losses. Before you know it, you're flying high, feeling like the master of the trading universe. But, as you may have guessed, that's usually when things go south.

After chatting with a bunch of traders, I've come up with a formula to help protect them from going broke. First and foremost, a trader must understand that wealth is built through small, successive successes and acceptable losses. It's all about long-term gains, folks! Secondly, a trader must have a deterministic and strict portfolio management process that's not subject to change on a whim. One way to do this is by putting your capital in a smart contract with withdrawal systems. This ensures that you won't have the freedom to change the equation mid-trade because, let's be honest, adrenaline can make us do some crazy things.  
  
The percentage of the amount withdrawn should be appropriate to the trader's history of serious errors, but generally, it should range from 8 to 10%. Additionally, the time period from which money can be withdrawn should be sufficient enough for the trader to complete a trade, rest, and then return the money to the smart contract. The third thing is that the smart contract should anticipate that the trader may lose a significant amount in their last transaction. This can be achieved by having a box that compares the amount available after the last withdrawal to the amount before the new withdrawal, which should be at least 20% more than the previous amount withdrawn.  
  
Now, if a trader has made a profit and everything is going well, they should return an acceptable amount to the smart contract. This will allow them to keep trading after the designated time period. However, if the trader lost a significant amount in their last transaction and can't return a small amount to the smart contract, the contract will prevent them from trading for a day or two until they're ready again.  
  
There are various smart contracts available, each tailored to specific needs, like the time period and percentage of withdrawals. Of course, there may be some differences based on the journey, desired amount, or even the wallet used. Plus, if there's more than one trader sharing in the profits, the contract can be adjusted accordingly. So, there you have it, folks, a little formula to help keep your trading game on track and, hopefully, out of the red. Happy trading!

The VWallet smart contract is designed to facilitate the distribution of cryptocurrencies to traders or individuals over a specified vesting period. This README provides an overview of the contract, its functionalities, and how to use it.

## Introduction

The VWallet smart contract is implemented in Solidity and is intended for use on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It allows for the controlled release of Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens to a specified beneficiary address over a predetermined vesting period. This can be particularly useful for organizations and projects that want to distribute tokens gradually to team members, advisors, or other stakeholders.

### Key Components

-   `EtherReleased` and `ERC20Released` events to track the release of ETH and ERC-20 tokens.
-   `beneficiary` function to get the beneficiary address.
-   `start` function to get the start timestamp of the vesting period.
-   `duration` function to get the duration of the vesting period.
-   `released` functions to get the amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens already released.
-   `releasable` functions to calculate the amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens that can be released at the current timestamp.
-   `release` functions to release ETH or ERC-20 tokens to the beneficiary.
-   `vestedAmount` functions to calculate the vested amount based on the current timestamp.

----------

## Features

-   Controlled release: The contract allows for a gradual release of funds over time, ensuring that the beneficiary does not receive the entire allocation upfront.
    
-   Support for ERC-20 tokens: In addition to Ether (ETH), the contract supports the distribution of ERC-20 tokens, making it versatile for various token distribution scenarios.
    
-   Customizable vesting schedule: The contract's vesting schedule can be customized by setting the start timestamp and duration of the vesting period.
    
-   Security measures: The contract includes safety checks to prevent funds from being released before the vesting period starts and after it ends.

## Usage

To use the VWallet smart contract, you need to deploy it on the Binance Smart Chain and interact with it using a web3-enabled application or tool like Remix or Truffle. Here are the steps to use the contract:

1.  Deploy the Contract:
    
    -   Deploy the contract on the Binance Smart Chain by providing the beneficiary address, start timestamp, and duration as constructor arguments.
2.  Fund the Contract:
    
    -   Transfer ETH or ERC-20 tokens to the contract address to fund it.
3.  Release Funds:
    
    -   Use the `release` functions to release funds to the beneficiary when they become available based on the vesting schedule.
4.  Monitor Vesting:
    
    -   You can use the `releasable` functions to check the amount of funds that can be released at any given time.
5.  Event Monitoring:
    
    -   Keep track of the `EtherReleased` and `ERC20Released` events to monitor the release of funds.

----------

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to deploy and use the VWallet smart contract:

solidityCopy code

`// Deploy the contract with beneficiary address, start timestamp, and duration.
VWallet wallet = new VWallet(beneficiaryAddress, startTimestamp, durationInSeconds);

// Fund the contract with ETH or ERC-20 tokens.

// Release funds when they become available.
wallet.release();` 

----------

## Security Considerations

-   Ensure that the `beneficiaryAddress` provided during contract deployment is correct, as the contract cannot change the beneficiary address after deployment.
    
-   Exercise caution when interacting with the contract, especially when releasing funds, as once released, they cannot be reversed.
    
-   Always perform thorough testing and auditing of the contract before deploying it in a production environment.
